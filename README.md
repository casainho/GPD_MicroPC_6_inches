# GPD MicroPC 6 inches

I bought [GPD MicroPC](https://www.gpd.hk/gpdmicropc) on February 2021 and I previously owned the GPD Pocket 2 and GPD P2 Max.

Before buying MicroPC, I was using GPD P2 Max less than what I wanted because:
* **fan noise**: I like to read at bed but the fan noise was to much and was a problem to my wife. With my previous model GPD Pocket 2 there was no fan and no noisde at all!!
* **to big**: although having a 9 inches screen was nice, the total size of the computer was to big for me to carry
* **short battery life**: the battery life was only 3 or 4 hours while with my previous model GPD Pocket 2 I had arround 10 hours
* **fragile**: although it was thin and beautifull, it also felt fragile

So I moved from GPD P2 Max to GPD MicroPC and here are the points I like on GPD MicroPC:
* **no fan noise**: physical switch to disable the fan and so no noise at all!!
* **small size**: I love the small size, very easy to carry with may hands
* **decent battery life**: my Linux Ubuntu says 8h with light usage
* **robust**: feels robust

The points I hate about GPD MicroPC:
* **keyboard noise and clicky**: the keyboard size and layout are very good BUT everytime I press a key I need to do a big amount of force and it does a lot of noise!! this is unlike a regular computer keyboard, like the keyboard of GPD P2 Max

Some extra notes:
* **display blinks at lowest bightness setting**: for me, the lowest brightness is even higher and at this value I see the display blinking... luckly on Linux Ubuntu is easy to make all the image with less brightness and so I increase one step the display brightness to avoid the bliking and then I reduce by software with this command: xrandr --output DSI-1 --brightness 0.4<br>
I even did customize keyboard shortcuts on Linux Ubuntu to execute the line, so with key combination I can increase or decrese that xrandr --output DSI-1 --brightness value

Custom shortcuts:
* ALT + SUPER + [1 - 9] --> xrandr --output DSI-1 --brightness 0.[1 - 9], example: ALT + SUPER + 5 --> xrandr --output DSI-1 --brightness 0.5
